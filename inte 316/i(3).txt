 The main differences are:

Computation: Newton's method is generally more efficient for adding new points to an existing interpolation.
Stability: Newton's method is typically more numerically stable for higher-degree polynomials.
Ease of understanding: Lagrange's method is often easier to understand conceptually.
Flexibility: Newton's method allows for easy computation of lower degree polynomials from the same divided difference table.
